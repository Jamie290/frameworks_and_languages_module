Web Programming
===============

Level 5


Description
-----------

Web technologies are a foundation of modern software. Web technologies facilitate networked applications that are easily deployable. Web technologies can facilitate realtime interaction/communication.

Students are to understand the foundations of web technology (server/client separation).
The focus of the module is to accrue practical web programming skills.
By understanding web foundation technologies, students will have the prerequisite knowledge to work with more advanced libraries.
This module is to be delivered using bare-bones IDEs, standard language libraries and common builtin browser development tools.


This module attempts to give students the opportunity to practically interact with a range of core web technologies:
* HTTP Server
* URL components (scheme, domain, path, hash, query string)
* WebSockets
* Document Object Model
* CSS (including transitions and variables)
* HTML5 Canvas (including shape paths and requestAnimationFrame)
* Web Forms (POST)
* Browser Events
* Cookies/Sessions
* JSON
* Async requests
* HTML Offline Storage

Once the students have engaged with the above technologies in a practical way, students are to use CDIO to conceive, design and implement a simple practical project to demonstrate a range of skills acquired.
Template project ideas will be provided to support weaker students. 
More advanced students will be encouraged to be creative with their implementation.


Learning Goals
--------------

1. Understand the HTTP protocol by implementing a HTTP sever from scratch using raw sockets. 
    1. It should serve static files and dynamic content from a path.
    2. Create a simple server side Message Board (Web Forms) that tracks user identity (Cookies)
2. Understand WebSockets by implementing a WebSocket EchoServer and creating browser clients that can send messages via this server
3. Understand that webpages are based on a Document Object Model that can be manipulated with code (add, remove, update)
4. Understand that DOM elements can be styled/animated with CSS
5. Understand that complex custom shapes can be drawn with code using Canvas
6. Understand that data can be POST'ed by forms. This can be stored and returned with a GET requests
7. Understand that server and client can share data in the form of cookies
8. Understand that all IO in browsers is performed by asynchronous non blocking calls
9. Understand that browsers have a range of build in api's e.g. offline storage
10. Understand how to use developer tooling built into modern web browsers effectively
    * Network requests, Console/REPL, builtin debugger
11. Understand that rather than raw web technologies are a foundation. Complex problems often require the structure of established frameworks (linking to Programming Frameworks)
12. Understand the tools software engineers use to collaborate on code projects



Learning and Teaching Strategies
--------------------------------

* The module will be taught in a lab using mixed mode delivery as required, so that theory, practical and discussion can take place as required within one session.
* Students will demonstrate progress in their assignment and will have the opportunity to gain feedback of their understanding in each session through the artefacts they are working on.
* Students are to use version control and engage with 'professional behaviours' like code review and pair programming

* In industry, it is expected that developers engage with code-base's they are unfamiliar with add features. The final assessment of this module is for students to add a feature to another students project (preferably via a pull-request for students to understand the tooling professional developers collaborate on software).


Indicative Assessment 
---------------------

| Name | Type | Module % | Word equivalent |
|-|-|-|-|
| Guided Projects | Digital Artefact | 30% | 1200 |
| Personal Project | Digital Artefact | 50% | 2000 |
| Feature Addition | Digital Artefact | 20% | 800 |


Progression
-----------

* This module forms the foundation for moving on to larger frameworks and more complex development toolchains (see Programming Frameworks)


Support Materials
-----------------

Template/Example Projects include:
* HTTP Server
* HTTP Message Board
    * WebForms POST, GET, Cookies
* HTTP Shopping Basket
    * Cookies
* Network Chat
    * WebSockets, Events
* Network Paint
    * WebSockets, JSON, Canvas
* Poor man's Chromecast
    * WebSockets, DOM, Events
Each example is to be short (less than 100 lines) and require no external libraries (with the exception of raw WebSocket handling)

Description
-----------
"E-commerce Case Analysis" is an important professional group elective course for computer majors. The purpose of the case analysis course is to enable students to master the methods and perspectives of case analysis. The understanding of business applications can achieve the effect of repeating one thing and three , and accumulate knowledge and methods for students to optimize e-commerce projects, analyze problems and plan e-commerce solutions and projects in the future. Therefore, in the teaching process of e-commerce case analysis, we must recognize the significance of case analysis, understand the classification of e-commerce models, and master the analysis model and teaching model of e-commerce cases.
